# PDF Processing Enhancements

This document summarizes the changes made to improve PDF file processing within the `precek` project.

**Problem:**

Previously, PDF file processing was either missing or resulted in poor quality text extraction with artifacts and incorrect words, particularly for image-based PDFs. This negatively impacted downstream data storage and visualization.

**Solution:**

Implemented a robust, hybrid PDF processing approach that combines native text extraction for text-based PDFs with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for image-based PDFs. A text normalization pipeline was also added to clean the extracted text.

**Key Changes:**

1.  **`precek/src/services/multimediaProcessor.js`:**
    *   Added a new `processPDF` function to handle PDF files specifically.
    *   This function utilizes the enhanced `readPdfFile` from `helpers.js` to get the processed text.
    *   The extracted text is then stored in the database.

2.  **`precek/src/utils/helpers.js`:**
    *   Significantly refactored the `readPdfFile` function.
    *   Implemented a hybrid extraction logic:
        *   Attempts native text extraction using PDF.js for PDFs with a text layer.
        *   Falls back to OCR using Tesseract.js for image-based PDFs.
    *   Added `isValidPdf` helper function for basic PDF structure validation using PDF.js.
    *   Added `detectPdfType` helper function to determine if a PDF is primarily text or image based.
    *   Introduced `cleanExtractedText` helper function to perform text normalization (fixing hyphenation, removing control characters, normalizing whitespace, etc.).
    *   Ensured ArrayBuffer is sliced before being passed to functions that might consume it to prevent "detached ArrayBuffer" errors.
    *   Corrected various syntax and structure issues identified during development.

**Dependencies Added:**

*   `pdf-parse`: Although PDF.js and Tesseract.js were primarily used in the final implementation, `pdf-parse` was considered and might still be listed in `package.json`.
*   `tesseract.js`: For performing OCR on image-based PDF pages.
*   `pdfjs-dist`: For rendering PDF pages and extracting native text.

**Dependency Resolution:**

Encountered and resolved dependency conflicts (specifically related to React and Tailwind versions) by using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` during the installation process.

These changes provide a more reliable and accurate method for extracting text from various types of PDF files, improving the quality of data available for analysis and visualization.
